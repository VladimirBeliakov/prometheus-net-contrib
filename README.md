[![Build status](https://dev.azure.com/alexvaluiskyi/metrics/_apis/build/status/alexvaluyskiy.prometheus-net-contrib)](https://dev.azure.com/alexvaluiskyi/metrics/_build/latest?definitionId=13) [![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/prometheus-net.Contrib.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/prometheus-net.Contrib/)

A plugin for the prometheus-net package, exposing event counters and diagnostic listeners for .NET Core Runtime, ASP.NET Core, SignalR, GRPC, etc.

## Installation
Supports .NET core v3.0+ only.

Add the package from [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/prometheus-net.Contrib):
```powershell
dotnet add package prometheus-net.Contrib
```

And then start the collectors:
```csharp
public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        ...
        services.AddPrometheusCounters();
        services.AddPrometheusAspNetCoreMetrics();
        services.AddPrometheusHttpClientMetrics();
        services.AddPrometheusSqlClientMetrics();
    }
}
```
